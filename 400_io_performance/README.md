# io performance

This directory contains scripts for measuring and comparing [benchmark type] across Intel/AMD (x86_64) and Arm (aarch64) architectures.

## Scripts

- `setup.sh`: Installs required dependencies
- `benchmark_script.sh`: Script to run the benchmark

## Setup

First, run the setup script to install required dependencies:

```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

## Running the Benchmark

After setup is complete, run the benchmark script:

```bash
chmod +x benchmark_script.sh
./benchmark_script.sh | tee benchmark_results.txt
```

## Benchmark Details

[Description of what the benchmark measures and how it works]

## Output

The benchmark produces output showing:
- [Description of output metrics]

## Analysis

When comparing results between architectures, focus on:
1. [Key metric 1]
2. [Key metric 2]
3. [Key metric 3]

## Example Results

### x86_64 (Intel/AMD)
